An introduction to Coding for Women

## Coding for Women

Founders & Coders runs a full-time no-fee coding bootcamp. This Meetup group is for the "Founders & Coders: Coding for Women" sessions which run fortnightly on a Tuesday, 6.30-8.00pm from 12th July.

The sessions are peer led paired coding supported by F&C cohort and focus on two main levels: 

* Absolute Beginners (HTML,CSS, Github, basic web development)
* F&C Applicants/Pre-course requisites (CodeWars, Javascript, READMEs etc. Full requisites here[: http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/])

We struggled to be inclusive in the name and appreciate "Coding for Women" isn’t perfect. For the meetup the word “Women” includes:

* non binary
* trans
* genderqueer
* or any other non cis gender identity
