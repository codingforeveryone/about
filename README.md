An introduction to Coding for Women

## Coding for Women

Founders & Coders runs a full-time no-fee coding bootcamp. We also run a number of meetups for people who are interested in our course, who want to learn more about programming, or who want help with their startup projects.

This Meetup group is for the "Founders & Coders: Coding for Women" sessions which run fortnightly on a Tuesday, 6.30-8.00pm from 12th July.

The sessions are peer led paired coding supported by F&C cohort and focus on two main levels: 
* Beginners
* Pre-course requisities for applying to the F&C course

We struggled to be inclusive in the name and appreciate "Coding for Women" isn’t perfect. For the meetup the word “Women” includes:

* non binary
* trans
* genderqueer
* or any other non cis gender identity
